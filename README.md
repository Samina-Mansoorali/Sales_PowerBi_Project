# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

From 2020 to 2023, Superstore generated a total revenue of $733,946, with 12,503 quantities sold and a gross profit of $93,507, resulting in a gross profit margin of 12.74%. Despite an upward trend in sales each month, there are months where sales dropped compared to the same months in previous years. Furthermore, the bottom 10 states have consistently underperformed year over year, showing declines in sales compared to the previous year. For instance, California experienced a significant drop in 2021, with a -56.65% decrease in sales compared to 2020.


### Sales Trends

- Superstore launched with remarkable success in 2020, generating $484,247 in revenue from 7,581 orders. Q4 of 2020 was especially strong, with $179,627 in revenue from 2,871 orders, likely fueled by shifts in consumer behavior during the pandemic, which drove increased demand for essentials like office supplies and technology. This positive trend laid a solid foundation for the company’s growth trajectory.

- In 2021, Superstore encountered a slight revenue decline of $13,000, bringing in $471,247 for the year. Despite this decrease, the total units sold rose to 7,970, indicating stable consumer demand. 

- By 2022, Superstore rebounded, achieving $608,473 in revenue, and this upward trend continued into 2023, with revenue peaking at $733,946. The Q4 period remained the strongest each year, with Q4 2023 standing out, reaching $280,594 from 4,723 orders.

- However, December 2023 saw a slight dip, recording $6,762 less in sales than December of the previous year, suggesting some end-of-year volatility. 

- Overall, while Superstore has demonstrated steady growth year over year, the majority of this progress is concentrated in key states, such as California, New York, and Texas, with other regions lagging behind. Addressing these regional disparities is essential for sustaining growth and stabilizing sales across all markets.

### Regional Performance

- As Superstore grew across the U.S., some states stood out for their strong performance, while others struggled. California, New York, and Texas were the top-performing states, bringing in more than half of the store’s total revenue. California alone made a huge impact, generating $17 million from 30,222 orders, showing it’s a solid and dependable market.

- On the other hand, the bottom 10 states contributed just over 10% of the total revenue, with each state having fewer than 1,000 orders. These low sales show that there’s a big opportunity for Superstore to improve its performance in these areas.

- For example, in 2021, Arkansas saw a loss of $8.10K, and Massachusetts also had a $5.44K loss. In 2022, North Carolina’s profits dropped by $5.04K, and Colorado’s went down by $4.90K. Even in 2023, big states like Texas faced challenges, losing $14.14K, while Alabama and New Jersey also recorded losses of $11.67K and $8.31K, respectively.

- These losses point to a growing gap between Superstore’s best and worst-performing regions. To close this gap, Superstore needs to focus on strategies that are tailored to each region. With the right approach, the company can improve sales in struggling states and create more consistent growth across the country.

### Product Performance

- Looking at product performance, Consumer goods were the top revenue drivers, accounting for 50% of Superstore’s total revenue from 19,517 orders. These products consistently sold well, contributing a solid gross profit of 11.55%. 

- Interestingly, the Home Office segment, which made up only 18.71% of sales, had the highest gross profit margin at 14.03%. This shows that although fewer Home Office products were sold, they were more profitable.

- Office Supplies were the most frequently sold, with over 22,902 units, but their gross profit margin was slightly lower at 17.03%. Technology products, despite fewer orders (6,937), had a higher margin of 17.40%, making them more profitable per item sold.

- On the downside, Furniture was the least profitable category, generating just 2.49% in gross profit from 8,025 orders. While it remains an important part of the product lineup, its contribution to profits is minimal.

- Among individual products, Phones and Chairs stood out as top performers, delivering gross profits of 13.49% and 8.11%, respectively. Meanwhile, products like Envelopes and Labels were low performers, contributing less than 1% to the company’s total revenue.

- Overall, this analysis shows that Superstore has opportunities to improve profitability by focusing on higher-margin products like Technology and Home Office items. At the same time, the company may need to reevaluate or optimize its strategy for lower-performing categories, such as Furniture, to enhance overall business performance.

- Focus on enhancing sales in high-potential segments like Technology and Home Office, which have the potential to generate greater revenue and meet customer needs.

- Enhance customer satisfaction by investing in better customer service and considering a loyalty program to create a positive shopping experience that encourages repeat purchases.
